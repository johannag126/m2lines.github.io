Sea surface height forecasts are influenced by many uncertainties. Traditional statistical methods help make predictions but often rely on assumptions that donâ€™t fully capture the climate system's complexity. In this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2024GL112835), **Andrew Brettin** and co-authors develop a machine learning model that learns a simplified representation of the climate system, **improving sea surface height predictions**. Their approach **outperforms methods that separate data compression and prediction**. Additionally, the model highlights key regions where better sea level representation can enhance regional forecasts.
