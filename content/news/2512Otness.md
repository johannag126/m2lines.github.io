In this [article](https://doi.org/10.1088/2632-2153/ae1a36), Karl Otness and co-authors present a new multiscale machine-learning approach designed to **improve predictions in dynamical systems**. The method captures information moving both from fine to coarse scales and from coarse to fine, **boosting model accuracy and stability**, with only **minimal added computational cost** compared to standard architectures. The team evaluates the approach on an idealized fluid-dynamics closure task, where the multiscale networks learn to correct a chaotic model by representing unresolved small-scale processes. The work highlights the **potential of multiscale AI architectures to enhance the reliability of physical system modeling.**
