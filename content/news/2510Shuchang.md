**Shuchang Liu** and **Paul Oâ€™Gorman** introduce **[CERA](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.00010), a machine learning framework designed to improve the generalizability of ML-models under climate change**. CERA uses an autoencoder with latent space alignment followed by a predictor to estimate moist physics processes. Trained only on control climate data with additional unlabeled warmer climate inputs, it **improves predictions in a +4 K climate and outperforms both raw input and physics informed baselines**. CERA captures shifts in precipitation extremes and the structure of moisture tendencies while reducing the need for manual climate invariant feature engineering, **offering promise for hybrid ML physics systems and applications such as statistical downscaling**.
