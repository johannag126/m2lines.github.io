Falga et al. present a [new machine-learning–based parameterization](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.01766) for **turbulent momentum fluxes that works consistently across both oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers.** Trained on large-eddy simulations, the neural network captures key turbulent features missed by traditional schemes and **significantly improves boundary-layer wind predictions in climate models**, reducing errors by a factor of 2–3 under convective conditions. The approach is robust to surface flux biases and generalizes well beyond the training data, **highlighting the promise of unified, data-driven turbulence closures for next-generation climate models.**
