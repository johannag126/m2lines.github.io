A new [paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL114951), led by **Julius Busecke** and **Dhruv Balwada**, highlights how small-scale air-sea interactions, often unresolved in climate models, can **significantly influence large-scale heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere**. Using high-resolution coupled simulations, researchers found that this small-scale variability leads to a **systematic global ocean cooling of about 4 W/m², with regional effects up to 100 W/m²**. These findings underscore the critical role of atmospheric wind and ocean temperature heterogeneity, offering new insights for improving climate model accuracy.
