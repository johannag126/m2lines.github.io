In this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.22676), M²LInES demonstrates the power of **AI driven methods in producing reliable climate simulations.** We introduce a new framework that brings physics- and scale-aware machine learning into climate models. Traditional parameterizations of physical processes often produce significant biases, but AI can now learn these processes directly from data. Our team **implements a suite of data-driven parameterizations in the ocean and sea-ice components of a state-of-the-art model**, ranging from deep learning to interpretable equation-based methods. Our results demonstrate that AI-driven parameterizations can run effectively in operational climate simulations, enabling **hybrid atmosphere–ocean–sea-ice modeling. All tools are open source and available to the community.**
