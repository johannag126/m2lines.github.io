Representing atmospheric turbulence in climate models requires estimating unresolved small-scale forces. This [study]('https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.173869578.80400701/v1), led by **Alex Connolly**, uses a deep neural network (DNN) to improve turbulence modeling by predicting these forces in large-eddy simulations (LES) of the atmospheric boundary layer. The DNN is trained on high-resolution data and tested across different conditions. Results show that **models using physics-based scaling perform better than those relying only on statistical normalization**. Embedding physical symmetries into the model further improves accuracy. This research **highlights the importance of physics-informed machine learning for improving turbulence representation in Earth system models for more reliable climate projections**.
