This [study](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.174835313.30541637/v1), led by Dhruv Balwada, introduces a **new data-driven parameterization to better represent how mesoscale eddies remove potential energy from the ocean in climate models**. Unlike the widely used Gent-McWilliams (GM) scheme, which can hinder resolved eddies and lacks a robust basis for tuning, this approach is both **flow-aware and scale-aware, minimizing negative impacts on resolved dynamics**. Built with a lightweight neural network, the method is efficient, easy to implement, and successfully tested in NOAAâ€™s MOM6 model. The results highlight a **promising path to reduce structural errors and improve the realism of climate simulations**.
