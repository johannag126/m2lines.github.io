The **[Ai2 Climate Modeling](https://allenai.org/climate-modeling)** team has released a new version of their climate emulator. In this **[latest release](https://github.com/ai2cm/ace/releases/tag/2025.7.0), Samudra**, the AI global ocean emulator developed by M²LInES, is now **integrated into Ai2's full model framework**.  We encourage you to check out the **[Ai2 codebase](https://github.com/ai2cm/ace)** and Samudra's **[original code](https://github.com/m2lines/Samudra)** to create your own ocean simulations.
