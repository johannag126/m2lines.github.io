In a collaboration between MÂ²LInES and AI2, researchers present **[SamudrACE](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.12490), a machine learning based global climate model emulator**. SamudrACE couples 3D atmosphere, 3D ocean, sea ice and land surface emulators to simulate centuries of climate at 1-degree horizontal resolution with 6-hourly atmospheric and 5-daily oceanic output. It produces 145 2D fields across multiple vertical levels with realistic variability in key climate phenomena such as ENSO. The **model remains highly stable and shows low climate biases** comparable to its individual components while capturing coupled climate behavior that uncoupled models cannot reproduce.
