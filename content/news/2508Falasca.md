This [study](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2506.22552) examines fundamental challenges in using data-driven models, especially **neural networks, for simulating complex climate dynamics**. While these models can often reproduce average climate behavior, they struggle to capture responses to external changes. The author, **Fabrizio Falasca**, shows that this limitation becomes especially pronounced when only partial observations are available, a common scenario in real-world climate systems. His **findings highlight the importance of incorporating physically informed methods**, like coarse-graining and stochastic parameterizations, **to improve the accuracy and interpretability of neural climate emulators**.
