The M²LInES team is proud to share this **[article](https://doi.org/10.21105/jose.00241)** and **[Jupyter Book](https://m2lines.github.io/L96_demo/intro.html)** published in the Journal of Open Science Education (JOSE) and led by Dhruv Balwada. Developed by our team, it aims to introduce Machine Learning (ML) methods to climate scientists and also climate modeling to machine learning experts. The book presents **a wide range of ML applications for climate modeling, focusing on hybrid AI+Physics methods using the Lorenz-96 model**. We hope this book can be used as a pedagogical tool for self-learning, a reference manual, or for teaching modules in an introductory class on ML or hybrid climate modeling.
