This new [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2601.17243) led by **Andrew Brettin** introduces a machine-learning framework to **better quantify uncertainty in extreme climate events.** The proposed ReLU-bias loss quantile neural network (RBLQNN) improves the **accuracy and stability of predicted uncertainty ranges**, especially for nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes. Tested on synthetic data, temperature extremes from over 1,500 NOAA weather stations, and satellite-observed precipitation, the **method outperforms standard approaches** and captures complex dependencies that simpler models miss. This work highlights **RBLQNN as a powerful, flexible tool for assessing climate hazards and extremes.**
