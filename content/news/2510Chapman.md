Led by **Will Chapman**, this [paper](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-18-5451-2025) presents the **first atmosphere connected supermodel linking CAM5 and CAM6**, which exchange information interactively to form a new dynamical system. In tests of a single untrained supermodel, the **models synchronize well across timescales** and preserve storm track variability even for variables without direct information exchange. Synchronization is weaker in the tropics, but key large scale patterns such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern remain intact, and for **some variables mean biases are reduced compared to the individual models.**
