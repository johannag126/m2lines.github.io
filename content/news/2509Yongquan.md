Led by **Yongquan Qu**, this [study](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2508.00325) presents **PnP-DA** (Plug-and-Play Data Assimilation), a new method to improve forecasts in Earth system models. As part of the **LEAP project**, the team combines lightweight analysis updates with a pretrained generative prior to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches that assume overly simple error statistics. Tests on chaotic systems show that it consistently reduces forecast errors across a range of conditions, outperforming classical data assimilation methods. This approach points toward **more reliable and efficient forecasting tools for complex Earth system dynamics**.
