Introducing **Samudra**: a unique neural network global ocean emulator for climate! Named after the Sanskrit word for 'ocean,' Samudra is the first-of-its-kind 3D ocean climate emulator. It operates 150x faster than the original model and can run stably for centuries—all on a single A100 GPU. Dive into our [blog post](https://tinyurl.com/samudra-ai) and [article](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.03795) to learn more about this innovative advance in climate modeling!
