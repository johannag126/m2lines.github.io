A new framework from NCAR, called CREDIT (Community Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin), is making it easier for researchers to **develop and test AI-based weather prediction models**. Introduced in this [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-025-01125-6), CREDIT supports flexible model design and training, helping **address key challenges in AI-based forecasting**. Using this platform, researchers introduced WXFormer, a novel model that outperforms traditional forecasting systems like ECMWFâ€™s IFS on 10-day forecasts, while being much more computationally efficient. CREDIT aims to accelerate innovation and collaboration in AI-driven weather prediction. **William Chapman** and **Judith Berner** contributed to this research.
