Air–sea fluxes — the exchanges of heat, moisture, and gases between the ocean and atmosphere —play a key role in shaping weather and climate. Traditional models often treat these fluxes in a fixed, “one-size-fits-all” way, missing their natural variability. This **[LEAP study](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.03990)**, led by Jiarong Wu, introduces a new probabilistic framework that uses neural networks and observational data to **better capture both the average behavior and the uncertainty of these fluxes**. The results show that accounting for **this variability can influence ocean temperature and mixing**, especially during spring, offering a promising step toward more realistic climate and weather simulations.
