**Perezhogin** et al. propose in this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.08900), a **physics-informed neural network to improve the generalization of data-driven mesoscale eddy parameterizations** in ocean models. By applying local input-output scaling based on dimensional analysis, **their method adapts to different grid resolutions and depths**. This approach enhances energy representation and affects biases in both idealized and global ocean simulations. The scaling framework is broadly applicable and robust across configurations. Results show **competitive performance compared to traditional parameterizations**.
