**Gregory** et al. present in this [preprint](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2505.18328), a hybrid modeling approach that **integrates machine learning (ML) into the GFDL SPEAR climate model to correct sea ice biases in real time**. Two versions are tested: one that includes coupled feedbacks (HybridCPL) and one that does not (HybridIO). HybridCPL **significantly improves Arctic and Antarctic sea ice forecasts on seasonal and subseasonal timescales**. In contrast, HybridIO performs poorly due to unanticipated feedbacks. These results highlight the **importance of training ML models within coupled climate systems** for reliable predictions.
